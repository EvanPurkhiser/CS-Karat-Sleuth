## Project report

This is the final report due for this project

### Compiling the report to PDF

All that is required to compile the Markdown version of this report into a nice
looking PDF is the [Pandoc document converter
toolkit](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html).

After installing the toolkit simply execute `make` from the command line.
